      description: |
        Optimizes the delivery order using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
        
        **Algorithm principle:** Always visit the closest unvisited delivery point.
        
        **Step-by-step calculation example:**
        - Step 1: From Warehouse → Delivery A (5km) - closest delivery
        - Step 2: From A → Delivery C (8km) - closest unvisited
        - Step 3: From C → Delivery B (7km) - closest unvisited
        - Step 4: From B → Delivery D (6km) - only remaining delivery
        - Step 5: From D → Warehouse (20km) - return to warehouse
        
        **Final tour:** Warehouse → A → C → B → D → Warehouse
        
        **Total distance:** 5 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 20 = 46km

      summary: Optimize tour using Clarke & Wright algorithm
      description: |
        Optimizes the delivery order using the Clarke & Wright Savings algorithm.
        
        **Algorithm principle:** Merge delivery pairs that save the most distance, recalculating savings globally.
        
        **Step-by-step calculation example:**
        - Step 1: Compute savings for all delivery pairs using formula:
          Savings(i,j) = Distance(Warehouse,i) + Distance(Warehouse,j) - Distance(i,j)
        - Step 2: Sort pairs by decreasing savings
        - Step 3: Merge deliveries into tours according to savings, respecting vehicle constraints
        - Step 4: Repeat until no more merges possible
        - Step 5: Return final optimized tour sequence
        
        **Example for 4 deliveries:** Warehouse → A → B → D → C → Warehouse  
        **Total distance:** 44 km (improvement vs Nearest Neighbor: 46 km)
